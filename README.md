# Species-Classifier


# 🐾 Species Classifier Project

A web-based animal image classifier built with **Streamlit** and **TensorFlow/Keras**. This app allows users to upload an image and instantly receive a prediction for which species is present. The model is trained to recognize six classes: **cats, dogs, elephants, human, peacock, and pigs**. If an uploaded image does not match any of these categories, the app returns **Unknown / Don't Know**. The interface features a custom background for a pleasant user experience.
